<p>Never thought I&rsquo;d start a blog since I was too lazy for that as a world class procrastinator but, here it is anyway. I just got started with HTML/CSS a couple of weeks ago so to me it&rsquo;s more like a practice on those.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using Wordpress at first, but after playing around with it for some time I found it too complicated, or cumbersome. There&rsquo;s just way too many options or features that I would never need and it takes a lot of time to configure.</p>

<p>After a little bit of research online I decided on Github Pages and Jekyll. There&rsquo;re many well-documented tutorials on them that I found pretty beginner-friendly. The only prereqs are just some command line knowledge and HTML/CSS baiscs. Plus you will definitely learn by doing, which I think is the best way to learn programming.</p>

<p>Github Pages and Jekyll are just things that make life easier. Hosting your site on Github Pages is free, and you would avoid the tedious process of those setting up hosting package things. Simply create a repository named username.github.io and that&rsquo;s basically it. If you like to use custom domain you&rsquo;d need to set up DNS and create a CNAME file in the repo&rsquo;s root with domain name in it.</p>

<p>Jekyll is described as a static site generator, which seems to me, a complete beginner, that you will set up some templates, write some posts in markdown or markup, then Jekyll would grab them and insert into the layouts along with associated files, and convert them into a bunch of HTML pages. Everything is done on PC and ready for you to upload to the server. There&rsquo;s no user acounts or database and nothing like the complicated web-based CMS systems.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a very elegant and simple system that serves as a perfect blogging framework. It&rsquo;s straightforward yet super fast and powerful, and the flexibility is limitless. More importantly, it gives users full control over everthing in the site, and that feels pretty good.</p>

<p>Getting started with Jekyll is easy as well. Just install Ruby, then the Jekyll gem, fill out a configuration file, create some templates, add a CSS file, write some posts, fire up the server, deploy the site, and&hellip; boom! Done. If this still sounds daunting, you can always use the bootstrap which is basically done with one-click since it&rsquo;s packaged up and ready to go.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of Jekyll-powered blog online and it really helps to look at other people&rsquo;s source, and of course you can fork them or clone one&rsquo;s template. I do suggest, though, that you start with a bare-bones site and add features as you need them. Building the layouts and CSS file on your own is just more fun and it gives you a sense of achievement, well, kind of.</p>

<p>Okay, after quite a load of crap, I still didn&rsquo;t talk about anything practical. So I&rsquo;ll add some links to resources to make this look good.</p>
